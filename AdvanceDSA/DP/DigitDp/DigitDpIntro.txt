How to identify DIGIT DP problem....

1. Range will be given [l,r]
2. one statement will be given like eg. count the total number of digit which is equal to 3 in each number between [l,r]
3. range l,r will be very big like l<=r<= 1e9 or 1e15 or even 1e18...

hence brute force that is using a simple for loop will give tle in such question hence we have to use Digit DP

and also to solve such problem we solve it like the prefix sums
that is

solve(l,r) = solve(r) - solve(l-1);

suppose l = 12345
suppose r = 45678

then 

_ _ _ _ _

what digit can we fill at first _
0 
1 
2
3
4

here {0,1,2,3} make group1 that is if we chose one of these we can put 0-9 in age ke dashes
but {4} make group2 that is if i chose this then in age ke group i have to make group of next index to decide further means its creaitng the restriction....



dp state will be defined by 

if range limit max is 1e18 means it will have 19 digits so we will for safety take 20
as first state 
 dp[][][] -> dp[20][][]

 now to tell group that which group we will put we will use a variable name as tight

 dp[20][tight][]

 hence these two states are compulsory now then we can add state accordingly to the questions

 so in dp
 first dimentsion will indicate index
 2nd dimenstion will indicate tight
 3rd dimentaiton will tell how many 3 appreard ...(accc to ques)..

 tight will be of boolean if tight is true means ->restriction
 if tight is false -> non restriction

 that is if we put group 1 then we will in non restriction mode
 but if we put group 2 (i,e last digit) we will be in restriction mode...

# shuruat hmesa tight = true se hi hogi ... that is we will be in restriction mode...
# also ek bar bhi agar tight false hua means hum non restriction mode mai agye fir hmesa tight false hi rhega that is hum non restriction mode mai hi rhenge
