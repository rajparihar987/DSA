🚀 Line Sweep Technique — The Core Idea
⭐ MOST IMPORTANT THING

Convert a problem over intervals / ranges / events into ordered events on a line, then process them in sorted order while maintaining an active state.

That’s it. Everything else is just implementation detail.

🧠 When to Use Line Sweep (VERY IMPORTANT)

Use Line Sweep when you see ANY of these patterns:

🔹 1. Interval Problems

Overlapping intervals

Maximum overlaps at a point

Minimum number of resources (rooms, platforms, servers)

Examples:

Meeting rooms

Train platforms

Overlapping segments

Range add/remove queries

🔹 2. “At any point in time” type questions

Keywords:

simultaneously

at the same time

maximum active

how many are happening

🔹 3. Geometry / Events on X or Time axis

Rectangles overlapping

Vertical / horizontal sweeps

Queries like “how many points inside”

🧩 How to Use Line Sweep (STEP-BY-STEP)
Step 1️⃣: Convert intervals into events

For interval [L, R]:

Event	Meaning
(L, +1)	interval starts
(R, -1)	interval ends

Sometimes end is (R+1, -1) depending on inclusiveness

Step 2️⃣: Sort all events

Sort by position

If same position:

start (+1) before end (-1) (VERY IMPORTANT)

Step 3️⃣: Sweep left to right

Maintain:

active = current active intervals

ans = max / min / required value

active += event_value;
ans = max(ans, active);

🧪 Small Example (Classic)

Intervals:

[1,3], [2,5], [4,6]


Events:

(1,+1)
(2,+1)
(3,-1)
(4,+1)
(5,-1)
(6,-1)


Sweep:

pos=1 → active=1
pos=2 → active=2  ⭐ max overlap
pos=3 → active=1
pos=4 → active=2
...


Answer = 2

⚠️ Most Common Mistakes (EXAM GOLD)
❌ Wrong event ordering

If two events at same point:

start (+1) BEFORE end (-1)


Otherwise answer breaks.

❌ Inclusiveness confusion

Closed interval [L, R]

Half open [L, R)

👉 Decide clearly before coding.

🏆 Time & Space Complexity
Metric	Value
Time	O(N log N) (sorting events)
Space	O(N)

Much faster than brute force O(N²).

🧠 Mental Checklist (Before Applying Line Sweep)

Ask yourself:

Can I convert this to start/end events?

Does order matter more than exact positions?

Do I need max / count / overlap at any point?

If YES → Line Sweep 💯
